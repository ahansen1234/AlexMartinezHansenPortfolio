# Alexander Martinez Hansen

Hello, I am a Software Engineer who is committed to building unique and engaging
applications that enable people in their personal and professional lives! Programming
allows me to exercise my creative freedom in a medium of logic and problem solving;
a combination which continues to excite me each day since I saw my first 'for loop'.
I graduated from the University of Michigan College of Engineering in 2019. Each
project I complete brings new knowledge and experiences and only fuels my captivation
with the industry as a whole. When I am not in front of a computer, you can find
me skiing or climbing the Sierras, painting/sketching my newest art project, or possibly
biking in the Santa Cruz mountains. If you have any questions, please contact me
at alex.c.hansen@gmail.com.
